# Overview
In 2021, a group was made by the name Minorites, with the members being Nexus, Rohan, Gribben, Icy, and RecRoom2016 (tags wont be stated for security reasons)

In late 2021 post september it was then subsequently patched by the Rec Room developer team.

In 2022 there was another attempt at unpatching by Minorities but it did not succeed, but another attempt was made by Mathie which worked but also got patched.

This is the only offical source of Harmonica.
